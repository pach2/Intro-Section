# Intro-Section

Hello! This is a simple website project I have done to showcase my skills in front-end web development. For this project I have used HTML/CSS, SASS, Javascript and jQuery. The website is a landing page with different functions and animations, in which a user can...
- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
